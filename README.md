A calculator made for an assignment from iTunesU Stanford iOS Programming series, with extra personal additions and tweaks.
My very first iOS app! 

TODO: Allow the operation history to display more than one operation .
(e.g. "4 + 5 + 6 =" instead of the current "4 + 5 =", then "9 + 6 =").

TODO: Consider allowing operation history to show pending binary operations OR Binary operation buttons highlight on press.

TODO: Calculate according to order of operation.

TODO: Add an app icon.

Currently all buttons and operations are functional! Tested on virtual iPhones as well as my personal iPhone 6s, 
the app runs smoothly on both.
