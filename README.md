# calculatorer
A calculator made for an assignment from iTunesU Stanford iOS Programming series, with extra personal additions and tweaks.
My very first iOS app! 

TODO: Allow the operation history to display more than one operation .
(e.g. "4 + 5 + 6 =" instead of the current "4 + 5 =", then "9 + 6 =").

TODO: Operation history to show pending binary operations OR binary operation buttons highlight on press.

TODO: Have the calulations follow the order of operations.

TODO: Add an app icon.

Currently all buttons and operations are functional! It has been tested on virtual iPhones as well as my personal iPhone 6s, 
the app runs smoothly on both.
